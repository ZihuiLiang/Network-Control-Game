The code is to search for the draw configurations and output these configurations for network-control games where parameter $t=T$  and the size of configurations is bounded by SEARCH_SIZE (see src/main.rs). The current version sets $T=1$ and SEARCH_SIZE=100. One can run the code within 1 minute to get the result. Also, one can update $T$ and SEARCH_SIZE for any preferred test.
